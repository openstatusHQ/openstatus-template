## Our story

We met on Twitter in 2023, after couple of months of DM. We started to work on OpenStatus and were driven by these goals:

- Build something useful for other developers
- A real-world project with all the latest hot technologies
- Be Open-Source

## Our values

We are a small team of 2 people, we are a small company. We are not a VC funded startup. We are not looking for investors. We want to keep our freedom and build a substainable business while working on features that provides the best value to our users.

We also want to be transparent about our business. We are not going to hide our ups and downs. We are going to share our journey with you.

## Our mission

We want to make the web faster and more reliable for everyone, wherever they are in the world. To achieve this, we are building a platform that helps developers monitor their websites and APIs.

We are here to fight `us-east-1` privilege.

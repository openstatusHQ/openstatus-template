Sometimes the services you want to monitor are not accessible from the outside, you want to be able to monitor from your own VPC.

## Why private locations are important?

Private locations let you monitor internal or restricted services that aren’t reachable from the public internet. They run checks from inside your own network or infrastructure, giving you visibility into systems behind firewalls, VPNs, or VPCs.

## Status Pages

A status page helps you communicate incidents more effectively. It adds **transparency**, so users aren’t left guessing. It enables **proactive communication**, giving updates without users needing to ask. And it shows **reliability**, not just in uptime but in how you handle downtime and keep people informed.

With openstatus you can:

- **Customize**: [Pick a theme](https://themes.openstatus.dev) or contribute your own, update favicon,..
- **Private status pages**: Share report information internally without exposing it publicly, useful for operations and on-call teams.
- **Communicate**: Use status reports or maintenances to keep your users up to date of whats going on.

## Monitoring

Uptime monitoring helps you detect when your website or service goes down. Instead of learning about issues from users, you get **notified immediately** and can respond faster. You can also **monitor your APIs** to ensure they return the expected values within a **defined threshold**, helping you **catch** slow responses or failures before they affect users.

With openstatus you can:

- Global monitoring (28 regions / multi-cloud)
- [Monitoring as Code](/landing/monitoring-as-code)
- [Export opentelemetry data](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/)
- HTTP / TCP / DNS checker
- Assertions
- [Private Locations](/landing/private-locations)
- Notification channels like email, slack, discord,...

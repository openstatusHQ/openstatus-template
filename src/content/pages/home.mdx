## Status Pages

### Why do you need a Status Page?

A status page helps you communicate incidents more effectively. It adds **transparency**, so users aren't left guessing. It enables **proactive communication**, giving updates without users needing to ask. And it shows **reliability**, not just in uptime but in how you handle downtime and keep people informed.

### Why choose openstatus for Status Pages?

#### Customization

Make it yours. Pick themes that match your brand, customize colors, or contribute your own design to the community.

- [Pick a theme from our Theme Store](https://themes.openstatus.dev)
- Update favicon and branding
- Custom domains to keep your brand consistent

#### Visibility

Control who sees what. Share publicly or keep it internal—you decide.

- **Public status pages** for transparent communication
- **Password protected pages** for internal teams or clients
- RSS feeds work even on private pages with `?pw=` parameter

#### Communication

Keep everyone in the loop. Post updates and let users subscribe to stay informed.

- Create status reports for ongoing incidents
- Schedule maintenance windows
- Subscription channels: email, RSS/Atom, SSH

## Monitoring

### Why do you need Monitoring?

Uptime monitoring helps you detect when your website or service goes down. Instead of learning about issues from users, you get **notified immediately** and can respond faster. You can also **monitor your APIs** to ensure they return the expected values within a **defined threshold**, helping you **catch** slow responses or failures before they affect users.

### Why choose openstatus for Monitoring?

#### Global Multi-Cloud

Get a real picture of your uptime. Test from where your users actually are.

- **28 regions** across Fly.io, Koyeb, and Railway
- Multi-cloud means no single point of failure
- Check all regions in our [global speed checker](/landing/play/checker)

Read more [about uptime monitoring](/landing/uptime-monitoring).

#### API Monitoring

Make sure your API actually works, not just responds. Validate the details that matter.

- **Assertions** for status codes, headers, and body content
- **Thresholds** for degraded performance and timeouts
- Catch issues before they reach production

Read more [about API monitoring](/landing/api-monitoring).

#### Monitoring as Code

Stop clicking through dashboards. Define monitors once, version them like code.

- **YAML configuration** that lives in your repo
- [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openstatus-synthetics-ci) for CI/CD integration
- CLI for scripting and automation

Read more [about monitoring as code](/landing/monitoring-as-code).

#### Private Locations

Monitor internal services behind firewalls. Deploy our probes where you need them.

- **8.5MB Docker image** that runs anywhere
- Deploy on [Cloudflare Containers](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-deploy-probes-cloudflare-containers/), Raspberry Pi, or your VPC
- Monitor services not accessible from the internet

Read more [about private locations](/landing/private-locations).

#### Integrations

Export your data. Integrate with your existing observability stack.

- [Export to OpenTelemetry](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/)
- Set alerts in Grafana, Honeycomb, or any OTel-compatible platform
- Notification channels: email, Slack, Discord, and more

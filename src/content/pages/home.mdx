## Status Pages

A status page helps youcommunicate incidents more effectively. It adds **transparency**, so users aren’t left guessing. It enables **proactive communication**, giving updates without users needing to ask. And it shows **reliability**, not just in uptime but in how you handle downtime and keep people informed.
OpenStatus supports this by providing:

With openstatus you can:

**Theme store**: Choose from dedicated themes or contribute your own.

**Defined values**: Define which values you'd like to share: duration time, total requests or manually updates.

**Grouped monitors**: Organise related checks (e.g., by region or service) to give users a clearer picture of what’s affected.

**Private status pages**: Share report information internally without exposing it publicly, useful for operations and on-call teams.

**Communication**: Use status reports or maintenances to keep your users up to date of whats going on.

## Monitoring

Uptime monitoring helps you detect when your website or service goes down. Instead of learning about issues from users, you get **notified immediately** and can respond faster. You can also **monitor your APIs** to ensure they return the expected values within a **defined threshold**, helping you **catch** slow responses or failures before they affect users.

With openstatus you can:

- Global monitoring (28 regions / multi-cloud)
- [Monitoring as Code](/landing/monitoring-as-code)
- Export opentelemetry data
- HTTP / TCP / DNS checker
- Assertions
- [Private Locations](/landing/private-locations)
- Notification channels like email, slack, discord,...
